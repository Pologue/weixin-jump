Notes:  
1. Please reduce the open windows until there are two left that will be used  
2. Please avoid overlapping windows to ensure normal operation  
  
The technical power is limited, and it is only a semi-automatic (crossed out) single-shot type  
( ̄『 ̄)  
  
A little bit of thoughts:  
1. The jumping distance is not linear with the time of long pressing, the distance is short is easy to jump long, the distance is long is easy to jump short, and the distance is moderate is the most accurate  
2. Combos are scored quickly, much faster than special blocks
